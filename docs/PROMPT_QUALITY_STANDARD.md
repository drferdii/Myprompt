# Prompt Quality Standard — Sentra Prompt 2026

**Scope:** `apps/internal/sentra-prompt`  
**Authority:** `lib/prompt-quality/contract.ts` (runtime SSOT)

## 1. What is a "Good Prompt"?

A good prompt is **self-contained, unambiguous, and testable**. Anyone — human or LLM — should be able to read it cold and produce the intended output without asking follow-up questions.

Four questions every prompt must answer:

| Question | Field |
|---|---|
| Who is the agent? | `role` |
| What must be done? | `task` |
| What context matters? | `context` |
| What does good output look like? | `constraints` + `formatSpec` |

If any answer is missing, the prompt is incomplete.

---

## 2. The Super Prompt Schema (SSOT)

All structured prompts in Sentra Prompt conform to `SuperPromptSchema` in `lib/prompt-quality/contract.ts`:

```typescript
{
  role:              string   // Who the LLM is playing
  task:              string   // The concrete deliverable
  context:           string   // Background + stated assumptions
  chainOfThought:    string   // Internal reasoning guidance (never exposed to end-user)
  constraints:       string[] // Testable rules the output must satisfy
  formatSpec:        string   // Exact output format
  fullPrompt:        string   // Paste-ready, standalone prompt string
}
```

`fullPrompt` is the **only field sent to the LLM**. All other fields enrich it and feed the Optimizer's self-evaluation loop.

## 3. Quality Bar — Mandatory Rules

Every Super Prompt must satisfy all five rules before it leaves the Optimizer:

### Rule 1 — Specific over vague
Name concrete deliverables, audiences, and success signals.

| ❌ Weak | ✅ Strong |
|---|---|
| "Write some content" | "Write one 800-word LinkedIn article for Indonesian startup founders about bootstrapping vs. VC funding" |
| "Explain this code" | "Explain this Python function to a junior developer who knows Django but has never seen async/await" |

### Rule 2 — Constraints are testable
Each constraint must be checkable against the produced output. If you cannot write a pass/fail test for it, rewrite it.

| ❌ Untestable | ✅ Testable |
|---|---|
| "Be professional" | "Use no slang; no sentence shorter than 8 words" |
| "Keep it short" | "Maximum 200 words" |
| "Sound human" | "No em-dash (—) usage; max 1 question per paragraph" |

### Rule 3 — `fullPrompt` is self-contained
Paste `fullPrompt` into any chat interface and it must work without the other fields. No pronouns without antecedents, no "the above context", no assumptions the LLM cannot read.

### Rule 4 — Preserve original intent
Enriching a prompt ≠ redirecting it. If the user asked for a casual Instagram caption, the output must still be a casual Instagram caption — not a formal press release with hashtags.

### Rule 5 — Handle ambiguity explicitly
When the raw idea is vague, the Optimizer must:
1. Make the most reasonable assumption (do not stall).
2. State the assumption in `context`.
3. Surface genuinely open decisions as `[TODO: ...]` placeholders in `fullPrompt`.

```
Bad:  Silently invent a topic for "buatkan saya konten"
Good: Assume Instagram caption → state in context → add [TODO: confirm the actual topic]
```

## 4. Intent Detection

`detectIntent()` in `lib/transform/engine.ts` classifies a raw prompt into one of seven intents, used to select the appropriate framing and instructions:

| Intent | Trigger keywords (ID + EN sample) |
|---|---|
| `translation` | terjemah, translate, alih bahasa |
| `generation` | buatkan, bikin, buat, tulis, susun, create, write, generate |
| `analysis` | analisis, analisa, evaluasi, kaji, analyze, review, assess |
| `comparison` | bandingkan, compare, perbedaan, difference, vs, versus |
| `explanation` | jelaskan, ceritakan, explain, what is, apa itu, bagaimana |
| `debugging` | perbaiki, benahi, atasi, fix, debug, error, bug |
| `summarization` | ringkas, singkat, rangkum, summarize, summary |
| `general` | (fallback) |

**Authoring note:** `translation` is checked first because a prompt like "terjemahkan dan buatkan versi formal" contains both `terjemah` and `buat`. First-match semantics mean the more specific intent should be listed first.

---

## 5. Template Matching

`matchTemplate()` maps a raw idea to the closest pre-built template using two layers:

### Layer 1 — Synonym-expanded keyword scoring

Before scoring, user query tokens are expanded through a bilingual synonym map (`SYNONYMS` in `lib/templates/matcher.ts`). This means "bikin kode" matches the same templates as "create code" or "write code".

Scoring weights per token match:
- Slug match: **+3**
- Name match: **+2**
- Description match: **+1**
- Full name substring in query: **+4**

### Layer 2 — Semantic embedding similarity (async)

`matchTemplateWithEmbeddings()` enriches layer 1 with cosine similarity between the query embedding and cached template embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims).

Decision logic:
1. Keyword score > 0 **and** semantic winner matches → use keyword result
2. Keyword score = 0 **and** semantic score ≥ 0.35 → use semantic result
3. Keyword and semantic disagree, semantic score ≥ 0.55 → prefer semantic
4. Any embedding error → graceful fallback to keyword result

Template embeddings are cached in memory per process (computed once per slug, reused on subsequent requests).

## 6. Vocabulary Mapping Across Skeletons

The codebase has three places that describe "a good prompt." They use different field names but map to the same concepts:

| Concept | SuperPromptSchema | Transform skeleton | Template skeleton |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent identity | `role` | `# Role` section | `template.role` |
| What to do | `task` | `# Task` section | `template.taskStructure` |
| Background | `context` | `# Context` section | — |
| Reasoning | `chainOfThought` | — | `template.cotGuidance` |
| Rules | `constraints[]` | `# Constraints` section | `template.constraints[]` |
| Output shape | `formatSpec` | `# Format` section | `template.formatSpec` |
| Deliverable | `fullPrompt` | full assembled string | rendered template |

Transform and template renderers are **not yet migrated** onto `PromptQualitySchema` — tracked as P2 backlog.

---

## 7. Provider-Aware Prompting

Different LLMs respond best to different structural conventions. `MODEL_HINTS` in `lib/transform/engine.ts` encodes these:

| Model family | Convention |
|---|---|
| Claude (Sonnet, Opus) | Use XML tags: `<role>`, `<context>`, `<task>`, `<constraints>` |
| OpenAI GPT-4o | System message with numbered lists for multi-step tasks |
| Mistral Large | Direct, concise instructions — avoid verbose preamble |
| DeepSeek V3/V4 | Chain-of-thought prompting; step-by-step reasoning blocks |

The optimizer generates `chainOfThought` guidance but **never includes it in `fullPrompt`** — it is used only internally and never sent to the end-user or exposed in Sentry payloads.

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns (What Not to Do)

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Role: "You are an AI" | Provides no grounding | Name a specific expert: "You are a senior Python engineer…" |
| Task: "Help me with X" | No deliverable defined | "Write / Analyze / Summarize / Fix X and return Y" |
| Constraint: "Be helpful" | Not testable | Remove it — it adds noise, not signal |
| `fullPrompt` that references other fields | Not self-contained | Rebuild `fullPrompt` to include all context inline |
| Silent assumption | User intent corrupted | State assumption in `context`; add `[TODO:]` if uncertain |
| Leaking `chainOfThought` | Exposes internal reasoning | Keep CoT in `chainOfThought` field only; exclude from `fullPrompt` |

---

## 9. Evaluation Checklist

Before promoting a prompt to production or the template library, verify:

- [ ] `role` names a concrete expert or persona (not "an AI assistant")
- [ ] `task` specifies the exact deliverable and target audience
- [ ] `context` states all assumptions made from vague input
- [ ] Every item in `constraints[]` is independently testable
- [ ] `fullPrompt` works in isolation — paste it cold into any LLM chat
- [ ] No `[TODO:]` placeholders remain (they must be resolved before promotion)
- [ ] `chainOfThought` is non-empty for complex tasks and absent from `fullPrompt`
- [ ] Output conforms to `PromptQualitySchema.parse()` without throwing
